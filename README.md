# SecDroidBug
We have built SecDroidBug, an Android debugger that simplifies debugging and testing of Android Apps for security properties. Though there are several tools that analyze and debug the code of an App, there is no tool available for debugging an App for its security properties. SecDroidBug interacts with an App running on an Android device and monitors its behavior and reports when there is any sensitive data leakage by the App to outside world through network interfaces. SecDroidBug allows setting of breakpoints where it will stop the running App. It monitors running App from first breakpoint till last breakpoint. SecDroidBug can watch variables supplied by the user. On each breakpoint it will give the list of variables touched by each of these watch variables. The debugger considers user supplied watch variables and other variables that store sensitive information e.g, location, contacts, etc as sensitive variables. Between the breakpoints, if any variable touches a sensitive variable, debugger includes it in the set of sensitive variables. SecDroidBug maintains and gives a list of sensitive variables line by line between the breakpoints. If any of these sensitive variables are sent to outside world the data leakage is reported.
SecDroidBug requires Java source code of the Android App. Therefore it can be used only with Apps whose source code is available. It is extremely useful for App developers to debug their Apps for security properties.
